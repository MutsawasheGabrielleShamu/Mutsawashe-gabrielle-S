# Brief self-introduction

<p>Hi, Iâ€™m @Mutsawashe Gabrielle Shamu, but I also go by Gabrielle for short! I come from a legal background but I have a strong interest in tech, and I am excited to delve deeper in it. My previous CFG project revolved around Javascript following the 8 week kickstarter course. As my final project I created a functional & interactive WeatherApp using Javascript, HTML and CSS. i found javascript very interesting.

 <sub>Cultivatiing ideas and turning a visualisation into reality increased my interest in wanting to know more about javascript and product management.</sub>
